    <h1>Move to Sweden?</h1>
    <h2>Perks</h2>
    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>I love Swedish architecture. Read about the Architecture of Sweden on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scandinaviastandard.com/a-brief-history-of-scandinavian-architecture/">Scandinavia Standard</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/architecture_of_sweden">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
    <h3>Bike-friendly</h3>
    <p>After watching Not Just Bikes&rsquo; &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/ul_xzyCDT98">Why We Won&rsquo;t Raise Our Kids in Suburbia (and moved to the Netherlands instead)</a>&rdquo; video, living somewhere bike-friendly has become a personal priority. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.eurovelo.com/sweden">Eurovol</a>, the European cycle route network:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Sweden is a big, bike-friendly country with a well-developed network of cycle paths in and around its towns and cities and well-marked cycle routes around the country.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Innovation</h3>
    <p>As someone pursuing a career in technology, Sweden is highly ranked in various innovation surveys:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/innovation/facts-figures/scoreboards_en">European Innovation Scoreboard</a></li>

      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.prosperity.com/rankings">Legatum Prosperity Index</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Nordic Model</h3>
    <p>Read about the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordic_model">Nordic Model</a> on Wikipedia.</p>
    <h3>Personality</h3>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170331-how-do-younetworkin-anation-of-introverts">Swedes are generally introverted, modest, and risk averse.</a> I am too!</p>
    <h3>Scandinavian Design</h3>
    <p>Learn about Scandinavian Design on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scandinaviastandard.com/what-is-scandinavian-design/">Scandinavia Standard</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scandinavian_design">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
    <h3>Schengen Area</h3>
    <p>From the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schengen_area">Schengen Area</a> entry on Wikipedia:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Schengen Area is an area comprising 26 European countries that have officially abolished all passport and all other types of border control at their mutual borders. the area mostly functions as a single jurisdiction for international travel purposes, with a common visa policy.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Swedish</h3>
    <p>I took two introductory courses to Swedish during my undergraduate studies. Every opportunity I had to communicate in Swedish when I visited Sweden had me feeling like I had a superpower!</p>
    <p>Furthermore, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_language">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[Swedish] is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Danish</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Work Culture</h3>

    <p>Read about <a target="_blank" href="https://gomonday.se/en/discovery/work-in-sweden-the-culture-and-the-workplace">the Swedish workplace culture</a> by Go Monday.</p>

    <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
    <h3>Difficulty Making Friends</h3>
    <p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://panion.com/blog/disconnect-why-its-so-hard-make-friends-sweden-expat">Olga</a> and many other accounts by expats in Sweden, this is to be expected:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>P:</strong> You’ve lived in quite a few different countries. Is it more difficult to make friends in Sweden?</p>
      <p><strong>O:</strong> Absolutely, yes. I think it’s because of the way society is set up. For the most part, people’s friends are from their childhood or maybe university. Social interaction is based on planning, it’s not very spontaneous. It’s really tough to get yourself into someone’s schedule. I actually gave up on the idea of having what I guess you’d call “authentically” Swedish friends. I found it was much easier to be spontaneous with non-Swedes.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Difficulty Job Hunting</h3>
    <p>Listen to <a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/job-hunting-in-sweden/id1542457785?i=1000526354755">Samara's experience on the &ldquo;Job Hunting in Sweden&rdquo; episode</a> of Turning Point Sweden's &ldquo;Expats in Sweden&rdquo; podcast.</p>
    <h3>High Taxes</h3>
    <p>Everything Sweden <a target="_blank" href="https://everythingsweden.com/tax-in-sweden/">notes</a></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Tax in Sweden is high, and Sweden has the 2nd highest tax rate in Europe but, like Denmark, the feeling for tax here is not as hated as other places in Europe (like the UK).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>but subsequently states that</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>People in Sweden see the value and benefit of the taxes they pay, and therefore there is much more belief in paying taxes and dealing with the higher tax rates.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Housing Crisis</h3>
    <p>Read &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelocal.se/20170828/the-story-of-swedens-housing-crisis">The Story of Sweden&rsquo;s Housing Crisis</a>&rdquo; by The Local Sweden.</p>
    <p>Counterargument: Many major cities have housing crises.</p>
    <h3>Opinion Corridor</h3>
    <p>In &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/26/swedish-exceptionalism-coronavirus-covid19-death-toll">Swedish exceptionalism has been ended by coronavirus</a>&rdquo; by Erik Augustin Palm:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The idea of the &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_corridor">opinion corridor</a>&rdquo;, which has become infamous in the discussion around Sweden, helps illuminate why the country&rsquo;s Covid-19 debate has been so flawed. It refers to the narrow range of opinions deemed appropriate in Swedish media. Although not entirely different to other concepts on discourse parameters, the opinion corridor is a particular product of Sweden&rsquo;s attachment to consensus building. Ask any expat there and they&rsquo;ll tell you how committed Swedes are to this as an end in itself. They will probably also tell you that going against the grain in Sweden can have real consequences, whether it be social or career costs.</p>
